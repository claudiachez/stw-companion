# STW Companion — Claude Code Guide

> **⚠️ START HERE — branch.** **`staging` is the active trunk** — all feature work happens here.
> As of **2026-06-23** `main` was brought **level with `staging`** (the event-sourcing migration plan
> was completed and promoted), so a fresh clone is current — migrations run to **041**; if migrations
> stop at 021 you are on a stale checkout, re-sync. **First command every session:**
> `git fetch origin && git checkout staging && git pull --ff-only`.
> Feature branches cut from `staging`, PR to `staging`. `main` is promoted only by an approved
> staging→main PR (= a production deploy). (Note: `memory/` lives in local `~/.claude/`, NOT in the repo —
> never reference it in a prompt meant for a remote session; put anything a future session needs into the repo.)

## Ground Rules
- If instructions seem to conflict, **always ask before doing anything**
- Never force-push or reset `staging` or `main`
- Never push to `main` without explicit approval — that is production
- Write shared styling/logic/data **once** in the shared packages, never twice across apps
- **Every timestamp uses `fmtDateTime` from `@stw/shared`** — never `toLocaleString`/`toLocaleTimeString` or a local date helper (see Conventions → Timestamps)
- **All UI changes must work on mobile** — design for ≤390px first; test layouts at narrow width before pushing
- **After ~10 commits in a chat**, run the Session Close routine (see section below)

## Current Status — event-sourcing migration CLOSED + promoted to main; Phase 4 is next (handoff 2026-06-23)

**✅ PLAN CLOSED (2026-06-23) — legs/transaction-history event-sourcing migration is DONE and on `main`.**
Phases 1–5 shipped; the deprecated-column cleanup (migrations **034 + 035 + 041**) was applied and
**verified on BOTH PROD and SANDBOX** — all 14 columns dropped, rows intact, the app's category-derived
`basket` and leg-embed query return clean. Routines were reviewed (all 4 write only the new path) and a
PROD logical backup was taken (local, gitignored `backups/` — `*_pre-coldrop.json`) before the drops. `staging` was
promoted to `main`. The next work is **Phase 4** + other forward features (see Next Steps) — the
event-sourcing schema work itself is complete; do not reopen it.

**Latest (2026-06-23, PRs #40–#42 MERGED to `staging`) — Portfolio Overview + Trades polish:**
- **Portfolio Overview** ([`PortfolioDashboard.tsx`](packages/ui/src/features/picks/components/PortfolioDashboard.tsx)):
  "New Webinar Analysis" → **"Conviction Notes Updates"** with a full `fmtDateTime` "Updated:" stamp in
  the header ([`useLatestWebinar.ts`](packages/ui/src/features/picks/useLatestWebinar.ts) now selects
  `created_at`); "Latest Portfolio Changes" date moved into the header + green (`--acc`) border; Unpriced
  Legs / Stale Prices titles moved OUTSIDE their cards (shared `SectionHeader`); the "Run the IBKR sync"
  hint is now **admin-only**.
- **Trades tab** ([`TradesTable.tsx`](packages/ui/src/features/picks/components/TradesTable.tsx) +
  [`TradesFilterBar.tsx`](packages/ui/src/features/picks/components/TradesFilterBar.tsx) +
  [`useTradesFilters.ts`](packages/ui/src/features/picks/useTradesFilters.ts)): independent filter state,
  bar chrome matching the Ticker Details `FilterBar` ("All Baskets", full-bleed); **Open/Closed/All toggle**,
  Type (Shares/Options), Sector, trade-specific Sort (default **Opened newest**, + Closed newest/oldest);
  added **Contribution %** (closed) + **Opened/Closed date** columns; **column set follows the toggle**
  (Open hides closed-only cols + vice-versa).
- **Readability:** green-accent filled buttons/toggle standardized to **white** text (was black, low-contrast).
- **SANDBOX data cleanup (DB, not code):** deleted **30 orphan `legs`** (status=OPEN, no `leg_transactions`,
  `entry_price` null) that a seed/import had inserted directly — they showed as phantom "open" trades on
  Closed holdings. Sandbox now **42 legs, 0 orphans**. PROD was already clean (45 legs, 0 orphans).
  ⚠️ Re-running the old `plans/*import*`/seed scripts can re-introduce them (they write `legs` directly
  instead of via the diary) — fix the seed if you re-seed.

**All event-sourcing work is MERGED to `staging`** (PRs #37/#38/#39). Phases 1–5 are done (details below).
Authoritative spec: [`plans/legs_event_sourcing_redesign.md`](plans/legs_event_sourcing_redesign.md).
**Phases 1–3 verified on SANDBOX; clean import + post-import holdings fix applied to BOTH PROD + SANDBOX**
(see DB state). The next code task is **Phase 4** (see Next Steps) — not started.

**Why:** the old editor was split-brain — it wrote BOTH `legs` (directly) and `leg_transactions`, which
fought on save, diverged, and stamped synthetic dates. Now committed to **true event-sourcing**:
`leg_transactions` (**the diary**) is the only hand-written source; `legs` (**the scoreboard**) is a pure
trigger-derived projection. The editor + ledger write ONLY events.

**Weight model (host-confirmed, corrected 2026-06-18):** a diary row's `weight` = that leg's **lot**
(BUY) or **remaining** (SELL, 0 on full close). **BUYs accumulate** → `legs.weight = Σ BUY lots − sells`.
So **Initial position weight = Σ open legs' lots** (computed from the diary = `positionWeight().current`;
tracks current lots, falls after a trim) and **Current position weight = `holdings.current_weight`** —
the live weight **the routines restate weekly** (NOT Σ legs). Both display read-only in the editor; the
hand-typed `initial_weight` field is gone and the editor no longer writes `initial_weight`/`current_weight`
(routines own current; legs own initial). The earlier "Current = Σ open legs; Initial = typed" wording was
wrong — host confirmed the swap. The 90:10 (equity:options) / 20:80
(short:long) split is only the **default** for computing lots when the host gives a total with no per-leg
detail — held in `app_config`, with a per-position override on `holdings.equity_pct`.

**Phase 1 DONE ✅ + verified on SANDBOX** (`040_sandbox_verify.sql`):
- **Migration `040_legs_event_sourcing.sql`** — `leg_transactions += action_label`; `holdings +=
  equity_pct`; new `app_config` table (split defaults 0.90 / 0.20); **trigger 030 rewritten** to fire on
  INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, replay the diary, accumulate BUY lots, and **book realized on trims** (slice-weighted).
  Requires **037 + 039** first. (`host_quote` was added then removed — Notes is the single field.)
- `@stw/shared`: `deriveLegWeights` rewritten (90:10 / 20:80, expiry-aware, pins preserved) + new
  `positionWeight()` (Σ open legs). 45 tests green.

**Phase 2 DONE ✅ + verified on SANDBOX (browser):**
- **`PositionEditor`** = position fields + `equity_pct`; **Current weight computed** (read-only), **Initial
  weight editable**; open legs shown read-only (leg CRUD lives in the ledger — one edit surface).
  "Last Action Date" label; each open leg shows its open date.
- **`LegTimeline` = editable Transaction History ledger** (writes only `leg_transactions`): `+ Add event`
  (incl. new legs: Instrument {Shares/Call/Put} + Direction {Long/Short}), per-row ✎/✕ edit/delete,
  columns **Date · Action · Details · Price · Weight · Notes** (Details holds "Shares"/`$30C Sep '26`;
  one **Notes** column), newest-first, table on desktop / cards on mobile, **open/closed/all toggle**,
  **closed-leg rows dimmed** + "Closed"/"Expired" muted gray.
- **Resizable split** in `PicksView` — drag the divider between the list and the detail (15–80%).

**Phase 3 DONE ✅ + verified on SANDBOX (CXDO/IRDM):** detail-card P&L split per asset class, never
blended — **Open** shows Shares/Options return + lot; **Closed** shows per-asset return + portfolio
contribution. `closedPnlPct` + `closedPnlContribution` + `hasClosedPnl` in `@stw/shared`.

**Post-import holdings fix (Next Step #2) DONE ✅ on SANDBOX:**
- **`last_action`/`action_date` derived from each ticker's latest diary event** (`plans/post_import_holdings_fix.sql`).
  Same-day conversion ties (ADEA/CXDO/FIVN/GDYN/SHLS) resolve to the keep-open `New`; `Expired` →
  `Closed` at the holding level (last_action has no "Expired"). (At import time AMZN/HOOD/TSLA had no
  legs and were skipped — but that was a transient state, NOT a rule; **the host has since added real
  legs to the legacy names on PROD (2026-06-23)**. See the legacy-positions decision below.)
- **Baskets/categories** assigned from the 6/18 sector groupings; 3 new categories created
  (**AI Fraud / Verified Identity**, **Space & Satellite**, **Nuclear**); **IRDM moved Defense → Space & Satellite**.
- **Initial weight for fully-closed positions** now shows the closed legs' entry lots instead of blank —
  new shared helper **`displayInitialWeight`** wired into BOTH `HoldingDetail` (detail card) and
  `PositionEditor`. ARKK reads `1% → 0%`. 54 tests + typecheck green.
- **`revert_legacy_category.sql` applied** — removed the mistaken "Legacy Positions" category;
  AMZN/HOOD/TSLA are Uncategorized (Legacy is their **conviction tier**, not a sector).

**DB state — BOTH environments now on the event model (2026-06-19):**
- **PROD (`usmqbohcjcyszjxxvnqu`):** 038 + 039 + 040 + the import + `post_import_holdings_fix.sql`
  applied. **Verified: 42 legs / 60 diary rows**, last_action/action_date/baskets correct, reconciles to
  6/18. **STILL TODO on PROD: run `revert_legacy_category.sql`** — PROD has a *pre-existing* "Legacy
  Positions" category (old system) that AMZN/HOOD/TSLA still use; the env-agnostic revert clears it.
  Conviction on PROD is left to the routines (some cores not yet tier 5).
- **SANDBOX (`uolabcgbnrkhzpwuvzlk`):** same scripts + the revert all applied. Admin dev `.env.local` →
  sandbox, so **localhost reads/writes the sandbox directly**. 25 tickers / 42 legs.
- **PROD import gotchas (baked into `plans/prod_import/*` + the SQL files):** (1) PROD's STW
  `trader_id` = `64a779f9-13ba-4cb4-824b-d70dcab3a49b` (sandbox = `9ec36b89-…`); seeds now resolve the
  trader **by name**. (2) The Supabase SQL editor threw "Failed to fetch" on the one big import — it was
  split into 9 small files in **`plans/prod_import/`** (run `1_wipe` → `8_legs` → `9_weights` in order).
  (3) The wipe deletes **all** legs (PROD carried 28 stale ones from the old 029/030 system) with the
  `trg_leg_transactions_sync` trigger disabled during the delete.

**Decisions locked (see spec):** event-sourced; ledger-only leg editing (inline modal editing **deferred**);
one Notes column; trims book realized; >2 option legs split even; ledger newest-first; **a "convert to
shares" close is a real cash sale → book the option's actual exit price as realized P&L, never $0** (host
2026-06-18); **ledger Action verb = bold green for OPEN-leg events, plain gray for CLOSED-leg events**;
**P&L is split by asset class (Shares vs Options), never blended** — Open shows per-asset return + lot;
Closed shows per-asset return + **portfolio contribution** (return × sold weight), so a +600% option on a
thin slice reads as its true ~+3.6% portfolio impact (host 2026-06-18). P&L Breakdown is open-legs-only.
**"Legacy" is a conviction tier (Tier 6 / `c0`), NOT a sector/category** (host 2026-06-19). **Legacy /
low-conviction does NOT mean "no legs/data"** — every position the host actually holds carries leg +
transaction data regardless of tier, **especially while still open**; the host added real legs to the
legacy names (AMZN/HOOD/TSLA) on PROD (host 2026-06-23). So a tier-0 holding with open legs is normal —
never treat low conviction as a reason to leave a held position without legs. **Conviction is
owned by the routines** — set in the streaming run, never in a seed/migration (so the post-import fix does
NOT touch conviction; the 6/18 stars OSS/VPG/SYNA/VIAV/NBIS/ENS/AMKR/LEU/AMZN/TSLA are the routines' job).

**New plan docs (`plans/`):** `legs_event_sourcing_redesign.md` (spec) · `import_open_positions.sql`
(clean open-position import) · `post_import_holdings_fix.sql` (Next Step #2 seed) ·
`revert_legacy_category.sql` (drops the bad Legacy category) · `040_sandbox_verify.sql` (trigger test) ·
`legs_inspect.sql` (inspect legs/diary) · `zzadea_populate.sql` (seed test fixture).

**Tooling:** `pnpm` not on PATH — use `corepack pnpm …` or `~/.local/bin/pnpm`. No local Postgres (can't
run DDL locally — apply migrations via the Supabase SQL editor). Prod service key (read-only checks) at
`~/Documents/Claude/Scheduled/.supabase-service-key`. Sandbox anon key in `apps/admin/.env.local`.

**Phase 5 DONE ✅ (2026-06-19) — routines on the 040 event model** (out-of-repo
`~/Documents/Claude/Scheduled/*`; SKILL.md edits, not committed). All four updated:
- **morning + afternoon:** STEP 2.3 / STEP 3 rewritten — diary `leg_transactions` (`action_label` +
  `notes`=host's verbatim words) + **direct `holdings` PATCH** of `last_action`/`action_date`/
  `current_weight`; **`holding_transactions` path retired** (the still-live 033 trigger auto-logs a
  harmless audit row). **Lot semantics:** BUY weight = lot **added**, SELL = **remaining** (cost basis).
  **Split (90:10 / 20:80 from `app_config` + `holdings.equity_pct`) is initial-sizing fallback only —
  existing legs are NEVER re-split.** Upsize = keep existing legs, add the increment to the **named**
  leg (FIVN worked example baked in). Contract→shares = close option at real exit (never $0) + new
  shares leg **inherits the replaced leg's weight** (net-neutral); same-day close+open keeps the
  position open (`last_action` = the opening verb). Trim uses **cost-basis remaining**; an appreciated
  winner stated only in market % → **flag**, don't guess. `action_date` = the host's action date,
  written only by a real action.
- **friday-weighting:** direct `current_weight` PATCH (no `Hold` rows); **truth-up mismatch (snapshot ≠
  Σ lots, e.g. IRDM +600%) → flag, never rewrite lots**; legs reconcile adds missing only; **new STEP
  4d status-aging** — `action_date` older than the **previous** snapshot → `last_action='Hold'`
  (`action_date` preserved); Closed/Expired terminal.
- **transcripts:** conviction note — routine-owned, **mutable both ways on an explicit signal incl.
  promoting a Legacy (0)**; never inferred from sizing.
- **One-time SQL applied (PROD + sandbox):** `plans/conviction_618_stars.sql` (8 stars → tier 5;
  AMZN/TSLA stay 0) + `plans/fix_fivn_shares_weight.sql` (FIVN shares lot 3.5→2.5, net-neutral 6.0%).
- **PENDING (host) — NOT a repo task, doesn't affect the apps:** the stale **`gradoxx-daily-summary`**
  Cowork scheduled task (duplicates morning PART 1's Graddox) is an **orphaned backend object** — it
  still fires ~9am but has no working delete UI (absent from Cowork→Scheduled; its task page 404s; the
  delete API is desktop-client-gated). Task UUID `8377c152-0ffa-474d-9ec0-2281a92edb26`, org Claudia Chez
  `aea1699f-e0b8-4ed4-80b9-4abb5d0a7711`; the underlying skill is `skill_01UY6zPNf9Do8eR4voyUvtm6`. Being
  cleared via Anthropic support / desktop skill-delete. Also smoke-test the routines on their next live runs.

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 4 — admin Config + Manage area** — spec'd in
   [`plans/phase4_admin_manage.md`](plans/phase4_admin_manage.md). Config page edits `app_config`
   (`equity_options_default` / `options_short_long_default`); `useAppConfig` read hook in `@stw/ui`
   (note: `deriveLegWeights` has **no call sites** today, so app-side split-wiring is forward-looking).
   Manage area: **categories CRUD** (delete-guarded), **traders read-only**. One "Manage" nav entry,
   admin-local. No migrations expected.

2. ✅ **DONE — deprecated-column cleanup (034 / 035 / 041).** Applied + verified on PROD + SANDBOX
   (2026-06-23). Dropped 9 cols from `holdings` (`position_detail`/`last_*`/`ibkr_legs`/`exit_*`/`basket`)
   and 5 from `holding_transactions` (`position_detail`/`price`/`pnl_pct`/`leg`/`direction`). The
   event-sourcing migration plan is **closed** — nothing pending. (`holding_transactions` survives as the
   trigger-written audit log; full table retirement was never in scope.)

3. **Future features (not migration work):** inline 2-line leg editing in the modal (deferred until
   day-to-day use proves it's needed); `$100k` notional + SPY benchmark (the `spy_daily` table from
   migration 032 already exists; the population cron + benchmark UI are unbuilt).

**Known gap (not blocking):** the **"Latest Portfolio Changes"** Overview block can't render against
SANDBOX because the `recent_changes` view (migration 008) was never applied there — `useRecentChanges`
errors and the block hides. PROD has the view (block renders fine). Apply 008 to sandbox if you want to
verify that block locally. (The webinar "Conviction Notes Updates" block uses the same `SectionHeader`
mechanism and does render, so the pattern is verified.)

## One Monorepo, Two App Shells

This is a single pnpm workspace. Two thin app shells consume the same shared
packages and differ only by **capability**, never by forked components.

| App | Audience | Folder | Capabilities |
|---|---|---|---|
| Subscriber web | Subscribers | `apps/web` | Supabase auth + tier paywall (`AccessGate`); Portfolio page + IBKR Flex Query subscriber connection; Settings page (`/settings`) |
| Admin dashboard | STW editor | `apps/admin` | No paywall; Edit form, Users tab, IBKR badge + proxy writer |

Each deploys to its own Netlify site from the **same branch** (base dir differs).

---

## Repo Structure

```
pnpm-workspace.yaml          → packages/*, apps/*
package.json                 → workspace scripts (dev:web, dev:admin, build, typecheck, test)
packages/
  shared/  (@stw/shared)     pure framework-agnostic logic: types, tiers, baskets,
                             format, options, pnl, filters (+ unit tests)
  ui/      (@stw/ui)         shared React: feature pages/components, data hooks,
                             supabase/query-client factories, AppCapabilities context
apps/
  web/                       subscriber shell: router, Layout, auth, AccessGate
    netlify/functions/
      ibkr-flex.ts           serverless IBKR Flex Query proxy (JWT-auth, never exposes token)
    netlify.toml             (Netlify base dir = apps/web)
  admin/                     admin shell: no paywall, Edit + Users + IBKR
    ibkr_proxy.py            local IBKR writer (run on your machine, not deployed)
    netlify.toml             (Netlify base dir = apps/admin)
supabase/migrations/         001..041 — single source of truth for DB schema/RLS
CLAUDE.md                    this file
```

### Layer rules (keep them honest)
- `@stw/ui` takes everything via **props/context** — no app-specific imports, no env,
  no routes. The Supabase client + `VITE_*` env are created in each app and injected.
- Admin/subscriber differences flow through **one `AppCapabilities` context**
  (`isAdmin`, `canEdit`, `onEditHolding`, `showIbkrBadge`) — never scatter `isAdmin`
  checks deep in shared components.
- `@stw/shared` is the only home for derived-number logic (P&L, weights, sector %, date formatting).
  Don't re-implement it in an app. (End state: move the math into Supabase views/RPC.)

---

## Branch Strategy

| Branch | Purpose | Deploys to |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | Production | both Netlify sites — prod |
| `staging` | Trunk / staging | both Netlify sites — staging |

Feature branches: `claude/<feature>` → branch from `staging` → PR to `staging` →
PR `staging` → `main` when approved.

```bash
git checkout -b claude/my-feature origin/staging
# work across packages/* and apps/*; shared change is written once
git push -u origin claude/my-feature
# PR → staging for review, then staging → main when approved
```

---

## Local Development

```bash
pnpm install            # installs the whole workspace
pnpm dev:web            # subscriber app (Vite)
pnpm dev:admin          # admin app (Vite)
pnpm build              # pnpm -r build across packages + apps
pnpm typecheck          # pnpm -r typecheck
pnpm test               # unit tests (@stw/shared)
```

Env: each app needs `VITE_FINNHUB_KEY` (live prices) and the Supabase URL + anon
key (in `.env`, gitignored; see `apps/web/.env.example`).

---

## Deployment (Netlify)

Two sites, one repo, same branch — distinguished by **base directory**:
- Web site: base dir `apps/web`, build `pnpm install && pnpm --filter web build`, publish `dist`
- Admin site: base dir `apps/admin`, build `pnpm install && pnpm --filter admin build`, publish `dist`

`staging` branch → staging deploy; `main` → production (requires approval). Build
config lives in each app's `netlify.toml`; base dir + env vars are set in the
Netlify dashboard.

**Build-skip:** with a base dir, Netlify by default skips a build when nothing in
that dir changed — which silently dropped shared `packages/**` updates. Each
`netlify.toml` now has an `ignore` command that builds when the app dir, any shared
package, or a root manifest (`pnpm-lock.yaml`/`package.json`/`pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
changed, and skips doc-only commits. So a `packages/**` change now correctly rebuilds
both sites.

Add each Netlify URL to Supabase Auth → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs (Google
OAuth on web does a full-page redirect).

---

## Database (Supabase)

- Project: `usmqbohcjcyszjxxvnqu.supabase.co`; client created per-app and injected into `@stw/ui`.
- `supabase/migrations/` is the single source of truth (through **041**).
  **Claude authors migrations; you apply them** via the Supabase SQL editor / `supabase db push`.
- **Local DB backups → gitignored `backups/`** (never committed — may carry PII), named
  `<date>_<purpose>.json` (e.g. `*_pre-coldrop.json`). Take a fresh logical snapshot of the
  affected tables before any destructive migration (column/table drop). The Supabase MCP has no
  `pg_dump`; pull tables via the REST API with the service key, or `select json_agg(...)`.
- Tables: `holdings`, `graddox`, `graddox_levels`, `profiles`, `tiers`, `run_log`,
  `user_positions`, `holding_transactions`, `conviction_comments`, plus the event-sourced
  `legs` / `leg_transactions`, `categories`, `traders`, `app_config`.
  RLS on `holdings`/`graddox` restricts writes to `cc@claudiachez.com`. `user_positions`
  uses user-owned RLS — each subscriber reads and writes only their own rows.
  The admin IBKR proxy now prices STW's option legs and writes **`legs.mark_price`** (the old
  `last_pnl_*` / `ibkr_legs` columns on `holdings` were dropped in 034).
- **Transaction History is auto-logged by a DB trigger** (`stw_log_holding_transaction`,
  migration 016): any non-`Hold` change to a `holdings` row's `last_action`/`action_date`
  writes a `holding_transactions` row — so every writer (admin Edit form *and* the external
  scheduled routines) is captured with no client code. A dedupe guard on
  `(ticker, leg, action, event_date)` makes idempotent script re-runs safe. The admin
  "+ Add Event" form is a manual backup (a direct insert that doesn't touch `holdings`,
  so it never double-fires the trigger). This intentionally differs from conviction
  history, which uses explicit appends (see migration 015).

### Data sources / writers
The apps mostly **read** these tables; the rows are written by systems that live **outside this
repo**. Know who writes what before you reason about freshness or "why is this row here":

| Table | Primary writer | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `holdings` | **the routines** (see next section) | core position rows (`last_action`/`action_date`/`current_weight`/thesis/conviction/`category_id`); admin Edit form also writes. Per-leg sizing + prices live on `legs`/`leg_transactions`, not here |
| `graddox` / `graddox_levels` | **morning routine** (Graddox step) | GEX signal bias + levels |
| `conviction_comments` | **the routines** + `stw-transcripts` | explicit appends; `source` = `discord` or `streaming`; admin/users can also add notes |
| `holding_transactions` | **DB trigger** (no client) | auto-logged from any `holdings` write; never written directly by app or routine |
| `run_log` | **the routines** | ingestion audit + high-water mark; newest `digest` → "Latest Portfolio Changes" |
| `user_positions` | **web `ibkr-flex.ts`** | each subscriber's own IBKR account; user-owned RLS |
| `profiles` / `tiers` | auth + Settings | per-user creds/preferences, tier paywall |

"The routines" = three cowork cron tasks that ingest Discord into Supabase — **the primary writers of
`holdings`, `graddox`, `conviction_comments`, `run_log`.** They are not in this repo (they live at
`~/Documents/Claude/Scheduled/<id>/SKILL.md`); the next section documents the full flow. They write
via the Supabase REST API with the **service-role key**, which is why their writes bypass the
`cc@claudiachez.com`-only RLS on `holdings`/`graddox`.

---

## Data Ingestion — The Routines (out-of-repo, but the source of almost all data)

The apps render data that an external ingestion engine writes on a schedule. This engine is **not
checked into this repo** — it is a set of Claude cowork cron tasks at
`~/Documents/Claude/Scheduled/<id>/SKILL.md` (thin shims under `~/.claude/scheduled-tasks/`). It is
documented here because the Supabase schema is the contract between it (writer) and the apps
(readers); changing a table or the `legs`/`leg_transactions` event-sourced schema affects both sides.

**Mechanism (shared by every routine):**
- Reads Discord via **Claude in Chrome** (the user's own account — not a bot; the user isn't a server admin).
- Writes to Supabase via `curl` to the REST API using the **service-role key** (from `~/Documents/Claude/Scheduled/.supabase-service-key`), bypassing RLS. Every write uses `Prefer: return=representation` and is verified — an empty `[]` body is treated as failure.
- **High-water mark:** each routine first reads the newest `run_log.last_message_ts` for its channel, processes only messages newer than that, then writes a fresh `run_log` row. This makes every run idempotent — a message/recording/snapshot is processed exactly once, no matter which path fires.
- **Only extracts what is explicitly stated** — never infers actions, weights, or conviction.

**The four routines:**

| Routine | Cadence | Reads (Discord channel) | Writes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `stw-morning-run` | 9am wkdays | Graddox → `live-notes-portfolio` → (fallback) `stream-library-stw` | `graddox`, `graddox_levels`, `legs`, `leg_transactions`, `holdings`, `conviction_comments`, `run_log` |
| `stw-afternoon-run` | 3pm wkdays | `live-notes-portfolio` → (fallback) `stream-library-stw` | `legs`, `leg_transactions`, `holdings`, `conviction_comments`, `run_log` |
| `stw-friday-weighting` | 5pm Fri | `updates-portfolio` (weekly full snapshot) | `holdings` (weights only), `run_log` |
| `stw-transcripts` | manual (+ daily fallback) | `stream-library-stw` (webinar recording) | methodology `.md` (local), `holdings`, `conviction_comments`, `run_log` |

**Daily flow (morning / afternoon):**
1. Read `live-notes-portfolio` — the host's real-time buy / sell / upsize / trim calls **and** his DD/thesis (he posts thesis here, not in a separate channel).
2. For each changed ticker, write the **event-sourced** path (post-Phase-5): a `leg_transactions` **diary** row per leg event (`BUY`/`SELL`/etc. with `action_label`, `price`, `weight`=lot/remaining, `notes`=host's words) — the 040 trigger derives the `legs` scoreboard (status, entry/exit, realized P&L) — then a **direct `holdings` PATCH** of `last_action`/`action_date`/`current_weight` only. No `position_detail`/`exit_*` blob is written (those columns were dropped in 034/035).
3. That `holdings` PATCH **auto-fires the 033 trigger** → a harmless `holding_transactions` audit row (no client code; the routines never write that table directly).
4. For notable commentary, **append a `conviction_comments` row** (`source='discord'`) → becomes "Latest Comments"; refresh `holdings.summary`/`bullets` + `dd_updated_at` only when the durable thesis actually changed.
5. Write the `run_log` mark, including a multi-line **`digest`** → rendered as "Latest Portfolio Changes" in the Overview.
6. **Recording fallback:** if `stream-library-stw` has an unprocessed recording, delegate to `stw-transcripts`. (Morning also runs the Graddox GEX step first → `graddox`/`graddox_levels`.)

**Weekly flow (Friday):** read the full-portfolio snapshot from `updates-portfolio` and **truth-up every holding's `current_weight`** to match it (this is the weighting source of record; daily calls only nudge weights). A ticker in `holdings` but absent from the snapshot is flagged, not auto-closed.

**Webinar flow (`stw-transcripts`):** processes the newest unprocessed recording **exactly once** (dedup via the `stream-library-stw` high-water mark). From one Zoom transcript it produces **two outputs**: (A) a **methodology-analysis `.md`** — a fixed 10-section reverse-engineering of *how the host thinks* (not what he owns) — saved to `~/Documents/Claude/Projects/Stock Talk Weekly/StockTalk_Episode_<DATE>_Analysis.md`; and (B) **conviction notes** — a `conviction_comments` row per ticker (`source='streaming'`) plus a thesis refresh when the durable "why" changed. Output A is the **only** routine output the apps never read (a local research library, kept separate from position data on purpose).

## IBKR Pipelines (two separate systems)

### Admin — local option pricer
`apps/admin/ibkr_proxy.py` is a **local** Flask server (`localhost:8765`, self-signed
TLS) that talks to IB Gateway (`127.0.0.1:4001`) via `ib_insync`. The admin browser
calls it to price **STW's** option legs (arbitrary contracts, not just held positions);
the browser then writes the per-leg **`legs.mark_price`** / `mark_price_at` (`mark_price_source='IBKR'`)
to Supabase — the proxy itself never writes Supabase. (Pre-event-sourcing this wrote `last_pnl_*` /
`ibkr_legs` on `holdings`; those columns were dropped in 034.) Run it locally with IB Gateway
connected; never deployed.

The proxy batches snapshots for speed, then **retries any leg the batch returned empty,
one at a time** (concurrent frozen snapshots occasionally drop an illiquid contract).
An unpriced leg carries an `error` reason so the UI can explain it, never a bare blank:
`ambiguous` (strike not listed for that expiry) or `no_market_data` (resolved but no
bid/ask/last/close — likely illiquid / deep-ITM / far-dated). Map it via
`legPriceReason(leg)` from `@stw/shared` — the single source of truth for unpriced copy.

### Subscriber — Flex Query portfolio sync
`apps/web/netlify/functions/ibkr-flex.ts` is a **serverless** Netlify function that
calls IBKR's cloud Flex Web Service API to fetch a subscriber's **own** portfolio positions.
Security model: client sends its Supabase JWT → function verifies it, reads
`ibkr_flex_token` + `ibkr_query_id` from `profiles` via service key → calls IBKR →
writes positions to `user_positions`. The raw token never reaches the browser.

Required Netlify env vars on the **web** site:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` — already present (shared with the Vite client build)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — server-side only, must be added separately (no VITE_ prefix)

These two pipelines are independent. The admin proxy prices STW's positions; the
subscriber function reads the subscriber's own account. Do not conflate them.

## Conventions

### Timestamps
All UI timestamps use `fmtDateTime(val: Date | string | null)` from `@stw/shared`.
Output format: **`Mon D · H:MM AM ET`** (Eastern Time, year omitted).
- DB stores UTC; always display in ET via `timeZone: 'America/New_York'`.
- Label pattern: `[Action]: ${fmtDateTime(value)}` — e.g. `Last synced: Jun 5 · 7:46 AM ET`.
- Never call `toLocaleString` / `toLocaleTimeString` directly in components for timestamps.
- **No per-component date helpers** (e.g. a local `fmtStamp`) — import `fmtDateTime`. This covers every full "as of" timestamp: column labels, source lines, tooltips, alerts. (Exceptions: a date-only display like `action_date`, or a compact intraday tag like the Signals `@ 4:00 PM` price time — neither is a full timestamp.)

### Ticker links
**Any ticker shown anywhere in the UI must be a hyperlink to its detail page** — never
plain text. Use `<TickerLink ticker onSelect={onSelectTicker} />` from `@stw/ui` (free
text like a digest can be linkified token-by-token against the holdings set). This is a
standing rule: when you render a ticker, link it without being asked.

### Counts
"Positions" counts exclude the `CASH` balance row (it's not a position) and reflect the
active filter (closed hidden by default). The FilterBar count shows `N of {total}`.

### UI consistency (standing rules, host 2026-06-23)
- **White text on green.** Any filled `--acc`/green button or active toggle uses **white** text, never
  black/dark (black-on-green is low-contrast). Match the existing Save buttons (`color: '#fff'`).
- **Sibling tabs read as one app.** The Trades filter bar mirrors the Ticker Details `FilterBar` chrome
  (full-bleed surface bar, same control styling, same wording — e.g. "All Baskets", not "All Sectors").
  When you add a filter/list/blotter surface, reuse the established chrome rather than inventing a new look.
- **Overview blocks share one header pattern.** Title lives OUTSIDE the card via `SectionHeader`, with an
  optional right-aligned `Updated: {fmtDateTime}` stamp — used by the webinar, changes, unpriced, and
  stale blocks. Don't put a block's title or its date inside the card.
- **Admin-only action hints.** Instructions a subscriber can't act on (e.g. "Run the IBKR sync") render
  only when `canEdit`; the explanation still shows to everyone.

---

## Design System

- **Font:** Barlow Condensed (700/800) for the **STW logo** in the header only; system sans-serif (`font-sans`) everywhere else including page headings and login
- **Logo:** STW mic + green arrow SVG
- **Default theme:** Dark. Toggle persists to `localStorage` (`stwTheme`); light
  theme applied via `[data-theme="light"]`. Never hardcode colors outside `:root` /
  `[data-theme="light"]` — always use CSS variables.

## Session Close

Run this routine after ~10 commits or when wrapping up a session.

### 1 — Git hygiene
```bash
git fetch --prune origin          # drop stale remote-tracking refs
git branch --merged staging       # list local branches already merged
git branch -d <merged-branches>   # delete each one
```
Remote branches merged into staging: delete via GitHub UI
(Settings → Branches, or the "Delete branch" button on a closed PR).
Claude can attempt `git push origin --delete <branch>` but may get a 403 —
flag it if so and ask the user to delete manually.

### 2 — Supabase check
- Were any new migrations authored this session? List them and confirm the user has applied them via the Supabase SQL editor.
- If schema or RLS changed, remind user to verify on the staging project before shipping to prod.

### 3 — CLAUDE.md review
Review every section and ask: *does this still reflect the codebase, or is it stale?*
- Update migration count if new ones were added
- Update AppCapabilities list if the context interface changed
- Add conventions introduced this session (only if they're rules, not implementation details)
- Remove anything that's now discoverable from the code itself

### 4 — Staging deploy
Confirm the latest push to `staging` produced a successful Netlify build — but first decide whether a build was even *expected*.

Each `netlify.toml` `ignore` command builds only when the app dir, a shared
`packages/**`, or a root manifest changed (see Deployment). Check what the session's commits actually touched:
```bash
git diff --stat origin/main...staging   # files changed since last prod release
```
- **Only root/non-app files changed** (e.g. `CLAUDE.md`, `supabase/migrations/**`, `.github/**`): a **Canceled** deploy is *correct and expected* — there was nothing to rebuild. Leave it; do **not** force an empty commit (that just produces another no-op build).
- **App or shared code changed** (`apps/web/**`, `apps/admin/**`, `packages/**`) but the deploy is **Canceled or Failed**: this is a real problem (the `ignore` command should have built it). If it was canceled by a rapid superseding push, trigger a fresh build:
  ```bash
  git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger staging deploy" && git push -u origin staging
  ```
  If it Failed, read the Netlify build log before re-triggering.

### 5 — Session summary
Briefly list: what was shipped, any pending user actions (migrations to apply, env vars to add, manual branch deletes), and any known open issues to tackle next session.
