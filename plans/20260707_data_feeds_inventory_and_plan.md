## Part 1 — API Inventory (what we have, limits, what it does/doesn't serve)

| API | Key / access | Rate / quota (free tier we're on) | Serves today | Does NOT serve |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Finnhub** | `VITE_FINNHUB_KEY` (client) + same in functions' `process.env` | ~60 calls/min, 30 calls/sec burst | Live **stock** quotes (`/quote` → `.c`) across Picks / My Portfolio / Heatmap / regime badge; company `profile2` (used once, by hand, to seed `ticker_sector_map`) | **Index symbols** (`^VIX`, `^TNX`, …) — empty on free tier; **daily OHLC history** (we use TwelveData for that) |
| **TwelveData** | `VITE_TWELVEDATA_KEY` (client) + functions' `process.env` | **8 credits/min, 800 credits/day, 1 credit PER SYMBOL** (comma-joined batch does NOT save credits) | Daily OHLC (`/time_series`) for all MAs; the authoritative close source for VIX / VVIX / TNX (US10Y) / UUP / HYG; Sector-Rotation constituents; regime-daily's VIX/VIX3M/TNX + IWM/SPY/QQQ | Realtime intraday (we don't need it); anything beyond ~19–20yr history in one call (outputsize cap 5000) |
| **IBKR — local proxy** | `apps/admin/ibkr_proxy.py` → IB Gateway `127.0.0.1:4001` (`ib_insync`) | No API quota (local); Gateway pacing only | Admin-only: prices STW option legs → `legs.mark_price`; places/statuses real orders (`/place_order`, `/order_status`) | Anything cloud/subscriber; never deployed |
| **IBKR — Flex Web Service** | Per-subscriber `ibkr_flex_token` + `ibkr_query_id` in `profiles`, via `apps/web/netlify/functions/ibkr-flex.ts` | IBKR caps token reuse (~1 req / few min per token) | Each subscriber's **own open positions** → `user_positions` (delete-all-then-insert) | Closed-position history (open only — see Next Steps #9); intraday marks |
| **Anthropic** | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (functions only) | Pay per token; no hard cap | Macro daily recap AM/PM (`macro-recap-am/pm`), admin Regenerate. Sonnet → Haiku fallback (`MACRO_RECAP_MODEL` override) | — |
| **MarketWatch** (scrape) | none | none (defensive HTML scrape; returns `source:'unavailable'` on any parse failure) | Economic-event calendar (CPI/PCE/FOMC/NFP) via `macro-events.ts` → Event Risk overlay | Anything structured/reliable — explicitly an interim source per its header |

**The binding constraint is TwelveData's 8-credit/min free tier.** Everything slow or flaky in the
Macro/Picks cold-load path traces back to it. Finnhub, Anthropic, and IBKR are comfortably within
limits for our volume.

### Where each feed is consumed (code map)
- **Live quotes (Finnhub):** `useTickerRegime.ts`, `PicksView`, `PortfolioDashboard`, `HoldingDetail`,
  `LegTimeline`, `PortfolioHeatmap`, GEX charts, macro VIX/VVIX quote attempts.
- **Daily closes (TwelveData) via `maCache.ts`:** `tdDailyCloses` (single), `tdBatchCloses` (≤8/chunk,
  65s pacing), `fetchClosesChunked` (sector constituents). Consumed by every macro module hook
  (`useMacroIndicators`, `useVolatilityStress`, `useCreditLiquidity`, `useRatesDollar`,
  `useSentimentGauge`, `useSectorRotation`) and `useTickerRegime`.
- **Sector map:** `fetchSectorMap()` (`limits/api.ts`) → `useSectorMap()` (`useRiskConfig.ts`,
  1h staleTime) → Risk-tab `sectorConcentration`, detail-pane Sector row, Heatmap "Sector" grouping.
- **Scheduled writers (Netlify functions, service-role key, direct REST):** `macro-snapshot.ts`
  (web, `30 21 * * 1-5`), `macro-recap-am/pm.ts` (web), `regime-daily.ts` (admin, **NOT scheduled**).

### Feed usage by page / module (rate-vs-need matrix)

Refresh rate = how often that surface actually pulls the feed (TanStack Query `staleTime` for
live/on-load reads; cron cadence for scheduled writers). "Current plan" = the pricing tier we're on;
"Rate / quota" = that tier's hard limit. **Conclusion** flags where need vs. limit is a problem.

| Page | Module | Feed | Refresh rate | Current plan | Rate / quota | Conclusion |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Stock Picks** | Overview — Heatmap (Today color) | Finnhub | live, 60s staleTime | Free | 60/min | **OK** — ~53 held tickers, well under |
| Stock Picks | Overview — Sector grouping | `ticker_sector_map` (Supabase) | 1h staleTime | — | — | **OK once sync built** (stopgap today) |
| Stock Picks | List + Ticker Detail — live price/day-change | Finnhub | 60s staleTime | Free | 60/min | **OK** |
| Stock Picks | Ticker Detail — option leg marks | IBKR local proxy (admin) | on-demand (admin prices) | self-hosted | none | **OK** — admin-only |
| Stock Picks | Ticker Detail — regime badge | TwelveData daily closes | 1x/day cache | Free | **8/min · 800/day · 1cr/sym** | **CONSTRAINED** — paced ≤8/65s; slow cold load, can collide with Sector Rotation |
| **Macro** | Summary / Recap | Anthropic | 2x/day (8am / 4:30pm) | Pay per token | No hard cap | **OK** |
| Macro | Trend / Vol / Credit / Rates+Dollar / Risk-Appetite / Score Strip / Banner | TwelveData daily closes | 1x/day cache | Free | 8/min · 800/day | **CONSTRAINED** — the cold-load bottleneck (~10 series, paced) |
| Macro | VIX / VVIX live reads | Finnhub → TwelveData fallback | on load | Free | 60/min | **OK w/ caveat** — Finnhub free doesn't serve index symbols; always falls back to TD close |
| Macro | Sector Rotation | TwelveData daily closes (constituents) | 1x/day cache | Free | 8/min · 800/day | **CONSTRAINED** — largest symbol list; `fetchClosesChunked`, paced |
| Macro | GEX / Positioning | Supabase `signals` (morning routine) | 1x/day | — | — | **OK** |
| Macro | Event Risk | MarketWatch (HTML scrape) | on load | Free scrape | none | **FRAGILE** — interim source, `unavailable` on parse fail |
| Macro | 5D trend engine | `macro_daily_snapshots` (← `macro-snapshot` fn → TD) | 1x/day 4:30pm | Free | 8/min · 800/day | **CONSTRAINED + BROKEN on PROD** — stale writer, null scores until promotion |
| **My Portfolio** | Overview — Heatmap (Total color only) | stored marks (Supabase) | on sync | — | — | **OK** — no live day-change feed here by design |
| My Portfolio | Positions | IBKR Flex Web Service | manual sync | Free | ~1 req / few-min per token | **OK** — open positions only (closed history = Next Steps #9) |
| My Portfolio | Risk — sector concentration | `ticker_sector_map` | 1h staleTime | — | — | **OK once canonical** (ETF/Cash must be excluded, not `unevaluated`) |
| My Portfolio | Tailing | Supabase `holdings` | on load | — | — | **OK** |
| **Signals** | GEX charts | Finnhub + TwelveData | 60s / daily | Free | 60/min · 8/min | **OK** |
| **Backend (scheduled)** | `macro-snapshot` writer | TwelveData (~10 series) | 1x/day wkdays | Free | 8/min · 800/day | **OK when paced** — v1.1.0 (staging) chunks ≤8/65s; PROD still stale |
| Backend | `regime-daily` writer | TwelveData (~5 series) | proposed 1x/day | Free | 8/min · 800/day | **OK small** — daily is cheap; backfill spread across quota cycles |
| Backend | `sector-map-sync` (proposed) | Finnhub `profile2` | daily, only unmapped tickers | Free | 60/min | **OK** — fires rarely, a few symbols at a time |
| Backend | `macro-recap-am/pm` writer | Anthropic | 2x/day wkdays | Pay per token | No hard cap | **OK** |

**Read of the matrix:** every **CONSTRAINED** / **BROKEN** / **FRAGILE** row is one of three known
causes — (1) TwelveData's 8/min free tier (all daily-close reads), (2) the stale PROD snapshot writer
(promotion fixes it), (3) the MarketWatch scrape (interim by design). Everything else is comfortably
within limits. A **paid TwelveData tier** is the single lever that would clear the whole first group at
once — quantify against the 800/day budget in Phase B before recommending it.

## Part 2 — Current State (verified against PROD `usmqbohcjcyszjxxvnqu`, 2026-07-07)

### Sector map (`ticker_sector_map`) — 53 rows, 13 distinct sectors
Finnhub `profile2`'s taxonomy, finer and messier than a clean GICS-11:

| Finnhub sector | n | Notes / problem |
|---|---|---|
| Technology | 18 | catch-all — includes software, networking, identity |
| Electrical Equipment | 13 | **lumps solar (ARRY, SHLS, FSLR?), fuel cells (BLDP), batteries (ENS), grid** — too broad, wrong for a rotation/concentration read |
| Semiconductors | 6 | split OUT of Technology (GICS folds these under Info Tech) |
| Aerospace & Defense | 4 | reasonable |
| Construction | 2 | AMRC, GLDD |
| Retail | 2 | AMZN, GME |
| Telecommunication | 2 | IRDM, LUMN |
| Automobiles / Banking / Communications / Energy / Financial Services / Marine | 1 each | **Banking (JPM) vs Financial Services (HOOD)** split arbitrarily; Marine (PANL) is a singleton |

**Gaps:**
- **No auto-refresh writer.** The map was hand-seeded once from Finnhub. When a new ticker opens it
  gets no sector until someone re-seeds by hand. **CCXI** (a real, open 3.4% position — the "Agility
  Robotics SPAC") is already unmapped for exactly this reason.
- **ETFs / CASH have no market sector** and legitimately never will: ARKK (closed), SQQQ (closed
  inverse ETF), CASH (balance row). These should be *classified as "ETF"/"Cash"/excluded*, not left
  as an "unevaluated" red flag on the Risk tab.

### `macro_daily_snapshots` — 2 rows (7/6, 7/7), both BROKEN
Both rows have `engine_version = null` and **null `trend` / `volatility` / `credit` / `rates_dollar`
scores** (only `gex`/`regime`/`risk_appetite` = 35). `run_log` has **0** `macro-snapshot` rows.
→ **PROD is running the stale pre-instrumentation `macro-snapshot` build.** The fixed, paced,
instrumented **v1.1.0** writer (engine_version stamp, ≤8/65s pacing, run_log, 120s timeout) is on
`staging` and will not take effect on PROD until the pending promotion. Until then the 5D trend
engine has no valid trend/vol/credit history to read.

### `regime_daily` — 0 rows, never run
The `regime-daily.ts` writer (integrity-guardrails Item 3) exists and is correct, but it is a **plain
handler with no `schedule()` wrapper**, and the backfill (`?backfill=1&days=N`) was never invoked.
`run_log` has 0 `regime-daily` rows. So the regime gate has no history at all yet.

---

## Part 3 — Proposed Plan (phased, approval-gated)

The work splits cleanly into **(A) sector taxonomy**, **(B) feed reliability/instrumentation**, and
**(C) the two dangling integrity-guardrail items**. A and B need host decisions (Part 4) before code.

### Phase 0 — Unblock what's already fixed (no new code; approval-gated because it's a prod deploy)
- The stale `macro_daily_snapshots` writer + everything else is fixed on `staging`. This is resolved
  **by the pending `staging → main` promotion**, which needs explicit host approval (Next Steps #0).
  Nothing to build; flagged here so it isn't re-diagnosed as a code bug. After promotion, verify one
  fresh snapshot row carries a non-null `engine_version` + real trend/vol scores + a `run_log` row.

### Phase A — Sector taxonomy (the core of Next Steps #1)
1. **Decide the canonical taxonomy** (Part 4, Q1) — recommendation: a fixed **GICS-11 + ETF + Cash**
   set, stored as a code-level constant in `@stw/shared` (`SECTORS` union type) so the Risk engine,
   Heatmap, and detail pane all validate against one list.
2. **Add a Finnhub→canonical mapping layer.** Keep `ticker_sector_map` as the store, but its `sector`
   column becomes one of the canonical values. A small pure map (Finnhub label → GICS bucket) folds
   the 13 messy labels into 11 (e.g. Semiconductors + Electrical-Equipment-that-is-really-tech →
   Information Technology; Banking + Financial Services → Financials; solar/fuel-cell → decide:
   Energy vs Industrials vs Utilities). Live in `@stw/shared`, unit-tested.
3. **Auto-refresh path** (Part 4, Q2) — recommendation: a new scheduled Netlify function
   `sector-map-sync` that, on a cadence (e.g. daily or weekly), finds `holdings` tickers missing from
   `ticker_sector_map`, calls Finnhub `profile2`, maps to canonical, and upserts. Idempotent; logs to
   `run_log` (same standard as macro-snapshot/regime-daily). ETFs/CASH classified explicitly, never
   left null. This closes the "CCXI has no sector" gap permanently.
4. **Re-seed the existing 53 rows** through the new mapping (one-off SQL or a `?backfill=1` call to
   the new function) so history matches the canonical taxonomy.
5. **UI:** ensure the Risk tab treats "ETF"/"Cash" as excluded-from-concentration, not `unevaluated`;
   confirm Heatmap "Sector" grouping + detail-pane badge read the canonical labels.

### Phase B — Feed reliability (TwelveData pacing + instrumentation)
Mostly already done on `staging` (pacing helpers, run_log instrumentation). Remaining:
1. **Verify the paced cold-load actually populates** end-to-end after promotion (regime badge renders;
   snapshot scores non-null) — Next Steps #3/#6.
2. **Consider a shared TwelveData credit budget.** Today Sector Rotation + Ticker Regime pace
   *independently* and can collide at a chunk boundary (documented residual gap). A single
   module-level pacing queue would remove that class of flakiness — propose as a follow-up, not P0.
3. **Document the daily 800-credit budget** against actual consumption (snapshot ~10/day +
   regime-daily ~5/day + per-user cold loads) so we know how much headroom a paid tier would buy.

### Phase C — Integrity guardrails (Next Steps #2, independent of any merge)
1. **Schedule `regime-daily`** — add the `schedule()` wrapper + a cron entry in admin `netlify.toml`
   (after-close, e.g. `30 21 * * 1-5`), matching macro-snapshot.
2. **Backfill `regime_daily`** — invoke `?backfill=1&days=N` across a few quota cycles to seed the
   504-day percentile window (the writer is designed for exactly this; TwelveData rate limit means it
   walks back with `?before=` across multiple invocations).
3. **Live cron verification** — confirm both scheduled writers fire and log `ok` to `run_log`.

## Part 4 — Decisions (host-answered 2026-07-07) ✅

**Q1. Canonical taxonomy → GICS-11 + ETF + Cash.** Fold the 13 Finnhub labels into the standard 11
GICS sectors plus explicit ETF and Cash buckets. Stored as a code-level constant in `@stw/shared`.

**Q2. Auto-refresh → new scheduled `sector-map-sync` Netlify function.** Finds `holdings` tickers
missing from `ticker_sector_map`, resolves + upserts them, `run_log`-instrumented, in this repo.

**Q3. Ambiguous names → use the AUTHORITATIVE MSCI GICS classification per ticker, not a blanket
default.** (Host: "use framework classification: https://www.msci.com/indexes/index-resources/gics".)
So each company is assigned the GICS sector MSCI actually places it in — resolved per-name during the
build, verified where a company's real GICS bucket is non-obvious (e.g. Array/Shoals solar,
Ballard fuel cells, Centrus/LEU nuclear-fuel). No "default everything clean-energy to X" rule.

**Q4. Promotion timing** for Phase 0 (the `staging → main` deploy that ships the fixed snapshot
writer) — still separate, host-gated, not yet given.

### What Q1–Q3 mean concretely for the build
- **`@stw/shared`:** a `GICS_SECTORS` union of the 11 GICS sectors + `'ETF'` + `'Cash'`; a
  per-ticker `TICKER_GICS` map for the current book (each held/tracked ticker → its authoritative
  MSCI GICS sector), plus a Finnhub-label → GICS fallback map for tickers not yet hand-verified.
  Both unit-tested.
- **`sector-map-sync` function:** for each `holdings` ticker missing from `ticker_sector_map`, resolve
  via `TICKER_GICS` first, else Finnhub `profile2` → Finnhub→GICS fallback map; ETFs → `'ETF'`,
  CASH → `'Cash'`. Upsert; log to `run_log`. Scheduled after close.
- **Re-seed:** map the existing 53 rows through `TICKER_GICS` (one-off, so history matches).
- **Risk tab:** `'ETF'`/`'Cash'` excluded from sector-concentration, not counted `unevaluated`.

## Part 5 — Free-alternative research + feed reassignment (host questions, 2026-07-08)

Before considering a paid TwelveData tier, researched every free option. **Conclusion: a free-only
path clears the entire TwelveData-CONSTRAINED group AND fixes the fragile MarketWatch scrape.** No
paid plan recommended yet.

### FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) — the big win
Free, single tier, **~120 req/min, no daily cap**, one free API key, authoritative. Directly serves
every macro *index* indicator we currently pull from TwelveData, plus the event calendar:

| Need (module) | Today | → FRED series | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| VIX (Volatility/Stress) | TwelveData / Finnhub-fails | **VIXCLS** | authoritative CBOE close |
| US10Y (Rates+Dollar) | TwelveData TNX | **DGS10** | actual 10Y CMT yield, no `/10` normalization hack |
| Credit (Credit/Liquidity) | HYG ETF *proxy* | **BAMLH0A0HYM2** (HY OAS) | **upgrade** — the real spread the module footnotes it's proxying |
| Dollar (Rates+Dollar) | UUP ETF proxy | **DTWEXBGS** (broad $ index) | actual index vs ETF; daily, 1-business-day lag |
| Event Risk calendar | MarketWatch scrape | **`releases/dates` API** | CPI/PCE/Employment/GDP authoritative dates — replaces the scrape |

Caveats: FRED daily series post on a ~1-day lag (fine for a daily-close dashboard). FRED does **not**
serve individual equity prices or **VVIX**. **FOMC** meeting dates aren't a clean FRED release — use a
small maintained/annual static list (dates are pre-published a year out) rather than a scrape or a
model guess.

### Equity daily OHLC (SPY/QQQ/IWM/RSP/VEA, sector constituents, per-ticker regime badge)
FRED can't serve these. Best free supplement is **Tiingo** (free "Starter"): **50 req/hr, 1000/day,
500 unique symbols/month, 30+yr EOD history** — far roomier than TwelveData's 8/min for our ~53-name
book + trend ETFs. Plan: Tiingo primary for equity EOD, TwelveData as fallback (or vice-versa), so
neither free tier is the sole point of failure.

### Rejected / fallback-only
- **Yahoo Finance:** no official free API in 2026; the reverse-engineered chart endpoint works but is
  fragile/unsupported (can add auth without notice) — same risk class as the MarketWatch scrape, so
  **not** a dependency. Acceptable only as a last-resort VVIX source.
- **Alpha Vantage:** free tier is now **25 req/day, 5/min** — too small to be primary; emergency
  single-series fallback at most.

### What this does to the paid-plan question
Offloading all macro indices → **FRED (free)** and equity EOD → **Tiingo (free)** removes essentially
the entire TwelveData load. **Recommendation: stay free.** Revisit paid only if Tiingo's 50/hr proves
insufficient on real cold loads — measure first (Phase B).

### Q: keep the raw Finnhub label after mapping to canonical?
**No — don't persist it.** `ticker_sector_map.sector` stores only the canonical GICS value; the raw
Finnhub label is an intermediate the fallback map consumes and discards. Keeping it as a column means
two "sources of truth" that drift. If a bad mapping ever needs debugging, `sector-map-sync` records
the raw label it saw in its `run_log` summary (transient), not as a schema column.

### Timestamps — every module footer needs the full time, not just the date
Standing rule (CLAUDE.md → Timestamps): every "as-of/updated/checked" stamp uses `fmtDateTime`
(`Mon D · H:MM AM ET`). Today **Rates + Dollar** and **Trend / Market Structure** (and others) show a
date-only stamp. Fix: each module's `SourceNote` shows a full `fmtDateTime` **"Updated"** stamp
(when we last refreshed), kept distinct from the **"Data through {date}"** daily-bar close date, which
is legitimately date-only. Audit all 11 modules for this in the build.

### Generalize the pacing guard to ALL feeds (host)
The ≤8/65s TwelveData chunker in `maCache.ts` proved the pattern; extract a **generic rate-limit /
pacing helper** (token-bucket or chunked-pacer, configured per feed: FRED 120/min, Finnhub 60/min,
Tiingo 50/hr, TwelveData 8/min) that every feed routes through, so a new feed can't reintroduce this
class of bug. Lives once in a shared util; each caller passes its feed's limit.

### Sequencing + keys (host, 2026-07-08)
- **Feeds first**, then sector taxonomy. Build order within feeds: (1) shared generic pacing helper →
  (2) FRED client + reassign VIX/US10Y/credit/dollar → (3) Event Risk rebuild (FRED calendar + static
  FOMC) → (4) Tiingo equity-EOD primary + TwelveData fallback → (5) timestamp audit across 11 modules.
- **Keys:** the host registers the free `FRED_API_KEY` (and `TIINGO_API_KEY` if adopted) and adds them
  to Netlify env on both sites; I write all wiring. Code graceful-degrades when a key is absent
  (module cell → `—`, same as the current missing-TwelveData behavior) so nothing hard-fails
  pre-provisioning. Live verification waits on the keys.

### Architecture: FRED is server-only (CORS) → proxy function
FRED's `api.stlouisfed.org` sends **no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header**, so a browser `fetch`
is blocked — FRED cannot be called directly from the macro module hooks. Access goes through a
**Netlify function proxy** (`fred.ts`, one copy per site per the site-scoped-functions rule) that the
browser hooks call; the server-side writers (`macro-snapshot`, `regime-daily`, `macro-events`) call
FRED directly. Bonus: the `FRED_API_KEY` stays **server-side only** (no `VITE_` prefix), unlike the
client-exposed `VITE_TWELVEDATA_KEY` — a security improvement, and the pattern to prefer for any new
key. Same applies to `TIINGO_API_KEY` if the equity-EOD reads move behind a proxy too (decide when we
get there; equity reads may stay client-direct on TwelveData/Tiingo since those DO allow CORS).

### Revised feed plan (net)
- **Macro indices (VIX, US10Y, credit, dollar) → FRED.** Fixes Volatility/Stress, Rates+Dollar,
  Credit; removes them from TwelveData.
- **Event Risk → FRED releases calendar (+ static FOMC list).** Retires the MarketWatch scrape.
  Anthropic may *phrase* the "why it matters", never *source* the dates (violates the recap's
  grounded-only rule / hallucination risk).
- **Equity EOD → Tiingo primary + TwelveData fallback.** VVIX stays a single TwelveData call
  (or Stooq/Yahoo last-resort).
- **New Netlify env var:** `FRED_API_KEY` (+ `TIINGO_API_KEY` if adopted). New scheduled
  `sector-map-sync` unchanged.
